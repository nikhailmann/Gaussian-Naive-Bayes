# Gaussian-Naive-Bayes
code that models the gaussian naive bayes classifier, an extension of the naive baiyes probalistic machine learning algorithm based on bayes theory, which is commonly used in a variety of classification tasks. Gaussine naive bayes specifically accounts for when predictor values are continuous and follow a Gaussian, or normal, distribution. Data is input through a .txt file in which each row has the following layout: Class Number, Data point dimension 1, Data point dimension 2. This code assumes that classes are sequential and start at 0; it also assumes that there are two dimensions of data points.
